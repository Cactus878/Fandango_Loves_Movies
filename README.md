The focus is on critically analyzing and improving the 2015 FiveThirtyEight article by Walt Hickey, titled "Fandango Loves Movies" (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).

The primary goal is to critique the data visualizations used in the original article, evaluate their effectiveness in communicating key insights, and propose enhanced visual representations using tools and techniques learned. This includes:
- Identifying issues in the original data analysis or presentation
- Recreating and improving upon the original visualizations using R and ggplot2
- Exploring interactive alternatives using Shiny
- Communicating insights more clearly and objectively

Learning Objectives:
- Apply data visualization best practices to real-world journalism
- Use R for data wrangling and statistical insight
- Build interactive tools using Shiny for deeper audience engagement
- Critically assess visual storytelling in media and suggest improvements
